Original key: D# natural minor, but actually more like C# Mixolydian

Intro
| C# | B    | F# | C# |x2

Gives more of C# natural minor feel due to the resolution to C#, but is in this case the V. 
As a result a strong feel of instead:

"Actual"            | V  | IV   | I  | V  |
What it feels like  | I  | bVII | IV | I  |
                    | C# | B    | F# | C# |

Verse 1
| C# | B | F# | C# |
| C# | B | F# | C# |

| G#m | B    | C# | C# |
| G#m | B    | C# | C# |

Similarily seems to be resolving to C#, again voice leading to the V of the tonic. 
Giving the mixolydian feel of 

"Actual"           | ii  | IV   | V  | V  |
What it feels like | iv  | bVII | I  | I  |
                   | G#m | B    | C# | C# |
