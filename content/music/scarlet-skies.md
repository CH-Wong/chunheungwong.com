I was lost on a path I forgot I was taking
In the smoke and the ash from a fire you made into a hope in my heart that has gone, 

Verse 1
Could you tell me, will we ever come back to this life?
Now we both have, so much left to be. 
I've forgotten, when did we last reach for where these skies and bridges lead.
When the air rises will you be with me?

Chorus
Fly away, fall up to when all of our dreams were real.
Finally, I could tell you that I'm sorry for everytime these 
Scarlet skies turned black and white  
If I burn down the lights around me, can you still make me see?

Verse 
You told me, my search is done,
One heartbeat is all I've won;
And I can't help but regret just what went wrong.
You took me, and all my thoughts, but hardly you gave me yours. Make up your mind, can't you let me be?

Chorus
And fly, fall up to when we had only dreamed,
Then I would tell you that I'm sorry for every time you cried,
Over all the things that we'll never be.
.
If I burn down the lights around me, can you still make me see.

Bridge
I see your fire, losing all control.
I can't deny her, but I can't let you go.
If we would fall here, could you just help me breathe?

Outro
I still hear your voice ring inside of me; 
Cover my eyes and I'll face this illusion.
If you'd throw out your lies and scream with me.

All of your words, they're calling me,
Into the night, where you keep our delusions.
Now just burn all the lights and scream with me.

Scarlet skies turn black and white
each time I look into your eyes. 
I don't know what is wrong or right, you tell me. x2
