## Lyrics

### Verse 1
Drift into a dream with me tonight
Where you held onto my arms what could be our one last time.
Is it wrong for me to wish to see,
the things that we would never be.
After all our dreams turn out to be a lie. 

### Verse 2
I wake up and the moment passes by.
I remember when you told me, "we're free to roam the skies!",
My "conquest is complete", "dim the searchlights", "the sun will rise".
You told me "I am yours" and you'll be mine.

Well.

### Prechorus
By the way, have you noticed day by day
how these memories we shared have gone away?
By the way, have you forgotten what it feels like,
when all the thoughts we had were you and me. 

### Chorus
Let's fly away, 
and fall up to when all of our dreams were real,  
And finally, 
I could tell you that I'm sorry for,
Every time these scarlet skies that filled our eyes,
had faded into black and white,  
If we could turn back around to find it, 
would you still make me see?  

### Verse 3
Honestly, 
I never though that I could be loved, the way I loved you.
That's why I'm afraid,
of a life stuck in a dance with what we have and,  what could have been

### Prechorus
By the way, have you noticed day by day
how these memories we shared have gone away?
By the way, have you forgotten what it feels like,
when all the thoughts we had were you and me. 

### Chorus
Let's fly away, 
and fall up to when all of our dreams were real,  
And finally, 
I could tell you that I'm sorry for,
Every time these scarlet skies that filled our eyes,
had faded into black and white,  
If we could turn back around to find it, 
would you still make me see?  

### Bridge *(To be rewritten)*
I see your fire, losing all control.  
I can't deny her, but I can't let you go.  
If we would fall here, could you just help me breathe?  

### Outro
Scarlet skies that filled our eyes 
have faded into black and white, 
I dont know how to make things right,
You tell me.

Scarlet Skies light up the night, 
each time I look in to your eyes,
I don't know if they'll stay this time,
You tell me,
