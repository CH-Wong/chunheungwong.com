## Lyrics
### Intro
Drift into a dream with me tonight.\
Where you held onto my arms,\
what could be our one last time.

Is it wrong for me to wish to see,\
the things that we would never be.\
All our dreams turn out to be a lie. 

### Verse 1
I wake up and the moment passes by.\
I remember when you told me, "*we're free to roam the skies*".\

My "*conquest is complete*", "*dim the searchlights*", "*the sun will rise*".\
You told me "*I am yours*" and you'll be mine.

*Well.*

### Prechorus 1
By the way, have you noticed day by day,\
how these memories we shared have slipped away?\
By the way, have you forgotten what it feels like,\
when all the thoughts we had were you and me. 

### Chorus 1
Let's fly away, \
and fall up to when all of our dreams were real.

When finally,\
I could tell you that I'm sorry for,

Every time these scarlet skies that filled our eyes,\
had faded into black and white,

If we could turn back around to find it, \
would you still make me see?  

### Verse 2
Honestly,\
I never though that I could be loved,\
the way I loved you.

That's why I'm afraid,\
of a life stuck in a dance with what we have and,\
what could have been.

### Prechorus
By the way, have you noticed day by day,\
how these memories we shared have slipped away?\
By the way, have you forgotten what it feels like,\
when all the thoughts we had were you and me. 

### Chorus 2
Let's fly away, \
and fall up to when all of our dreams were real.

When finally,\
I could tell you that I'm sorry for,

Every time these scarlet skies that filled our eyes,\
had faded into black and white,

If we could turn back around to find it, \
would you still make me see?  

### Bridge
I see your fire, losing all control.\
I can't deny her, but I can't let you go.\
If we would fall here, could you just help me breathe?

### Outro
Scarlet skies that filled our eyes \
have faded into black and white, \
I don't know if they'll stay tonight, \
You tell me.

Scarlet Skies light up the night,\
each time I look in to your eyes,\
I don't if they'll stay tonight,\
You tell me.
