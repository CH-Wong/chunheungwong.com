Intro 1
| D A/C# | B     | A C#m/G# | F#m     |
| F C/E  | Eb Dm | C rit.   | Esus4 E |

Intro 2
| Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | %    C#m/G#      |  
| Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# | 

| Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | %    C#m/G#      |  
Drift into a dream with me tonight.

| Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# | 
Where you held into my arms like you did that one last time.

| Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | %    C#m/G#      |  
Is it wrong for me to wish to see, the things that we would never be.  

(F#m7add9: play like E over F#m?)
| Dmaj7add9 | %  C#m/E | F#m7add9  | %    Fdim |
All our dreams turned out to be a lie.      

Verse 1
|  Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# |  
I wake up and the moment passes by. 

|  Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# |  
I remember when you told me, "we're free to roam the skies!",

|  Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# |  
My "conquest is complete", "dim the searchlights", "the sun will rise".

| Dmaj7add9 | %  C#m/E | F#m7add9  | Fdim C#(major!) |
You told me I am yours and you'll be mine.


Prechorus 1
| Bm7 | A/C# | F#m7 | Esus4 E |
By the way, have you noticed day by day

| Bm7 | A/C# | Esus4 | E |
how these memories we shared are growing cold?

| D | F#m | A/E | E/G# A |
By the way, I've forgotten what it feels like,

| Bm7 Bm7/A | Emsus4/G  | Esus4 | E |
When all the nights we shared have come to call?  

Chorus 1
(maybe swap first chord for Gadd9 to insinuate D major tonic for one more chord?)
| Dadd9 | Esus4 | F#m | E/G# A  A/E |
Let's fly away and fall up to when all of our dreams were real.

| Dadd9 | Esus4 | F#m | E/G# A  A/E |
When finally I could tell you that I'm sorry for every time these

| Dadd9 | Esus4 | F#m | E/G# A  A/E |
Scarlet skies that filled our eyes had faded into black and white,  

| Bm7 A/C# | Dadd9 | E | E |
If we could turn back around to find it, would you still make me see?  

Interlude
|  Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# | 
|  Dmaj7add9 | %  Esus4 | F#m7 | E/G# A      A/C# |  

Verse 2
| D7add9 | % | Esus4     | %               |
Honestly, I never though that I could be 

| F#m7   | % | F#m7 E/G# | E/G# Aadd9 A/C# |
loved, the way I loved you.

| D7add9 | % | Esus4     | %               |
That's why I'm afraid, of a life stuck in a dance with what we 

| F#m7 | E/G# A A/C# | D7add9 | Fdmin  C# |   
have and what could have been.

Prechorus 2
| Bm7 | A/C# | F#m7 | Esus4 E |
By the way, have you noticed day by day

| Bm7 | A/C# | Esus4 | E |
how these memories we shared are growing cold?

| D | F#m | A/E | E/G# A |
By the way, I've forgotten what it feels like,

| Bm7 Bm7/A | Emsus4/G  | Esus4 | E |
When all the nights we shared have come to call?

Bridge (Ensemble)
| Gadd9 | A | Bm7   | A/C# D |
I see your fire, losing all control.  I can't deny her, but I can't let you go.  

| Gadd9 | A | Esus4 | E      | 
If we would fall here, could you just help me breathe?  

| Gadd9 | A | Bm7   | A/C# D |
| Gadd9 | A | Esus4 | -      | 

Outro  
| Gadd9 | A | Bm7 | A/C# D D/A |

Scarlet skies light up the night each time I look into your eyes

| E D/F# | Gadd9 | Bb C | D |
If we could turn back around to find it, would you still make me see? 


### OLD
I was lost on a path I forgot I was taking  
In the smoke and the ash from a fire you made into a hope in my heart that has gone,  
  
Verse 1  
Could you tell me, will we ever come back to this life?  
Now we both have, so much left to be.  
I've forgotten, when did we last reach for where these skies and bridges lead.  
When the air rises will you be with me?  
  
Chorus  
And fly, fall up to when we had only dreamed.  
Then I would tell you that I'm sorry for every time you cried,  
Over all the things that we'll never be.  
If I burn down the lights around me, can you still make me see?  

Verse  
You told me, my search is done,  
One heartbeat is all I've won;  
And I can't help but regret just what went wrong.  
You took me, and all my thoughts, but hardly you gave me yours. Make up your mind, can't you let me be?  

Bridge  
I see your fire, losing all control.  
I can't deny her, but I can't let you go.  
If we would fall here, could you just help me breathe?  
  
Outro  
I still hear your voice ring inside of me,  
Your words bring me back to a handful of moments,  
That we shared in those nights that now seem like a dream,
