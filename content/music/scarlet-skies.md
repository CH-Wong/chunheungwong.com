## Lyrics

Verse 1
Drifted to a dream of you last night.
When I held you in my arms for what would be the only time   .
Is it wrong for me to wish to see,
the things that we would never be.
All our dreams turned out to be a lie. 

Verse 2
I wake up and the moment passes by.
I remember when you told me, "we're free to roam the skies!",
My "conquest is complete", "dim the searchlights", "the sun will rise".
You told me I am yours and you'll be mine.

Prechorus
By the way, have you noticed day by day
how these memories we shared are growing cold?
By the way, I've forgotten what it feels like,
When all the nights we shared have come to call?   

Chorus
Let's fly away, 
and fall up to when all of our dreams were real,  
And finally, 
I could tell you that I'm sorry for every time,  
These scarlet skies that filled our eyes had faded into black and white,  
If we could turn back around to find it, would you still make me see?  

Verse 3
Honestly, 
I never though that I could be loved, the way I loved you.
That's why I'm afraid,
of a life stuck in a dance with what we have and,  what could have been

Prechorus
By the way, have you noticed day by day
how these memories we shared are growing cold?
By the way, I've forgotten what it feels like,
When all the nights we shared  have come to call?  

Bridge *(To be rewritten)*
I see your fire, losing all control.  
I can't deny her, but I can't let you go.  
If we would fall here, could you just help me breathe?  

Outro *(To be rewritten)*
2x Scarlet skies turn black and white each time I look in to your eyes
I don't know what is wrong or right, you tell me
