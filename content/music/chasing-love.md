Written by: Chun Heung Wong (Aug 2009)

When I wrote this song, my only musical tools were essentially the pentatonic scale. I was already overwhelmed with having to think of melodies and harmonies myself after years of following classical music class. At the time, I wasn't aware that the melody was in 6/4 time signature. When I subsequently added the intro in 4/4, I was very surprised to realise the discrepancy, but also that it somehow didn't sound too unnatural. Maybe because the left hand initially sounds like a 4/4 accompaniment? Not so sure.
