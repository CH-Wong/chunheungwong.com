Here are the chords of the song [New Soul by Yael Naim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhE7QMXRE1g)[^sad-fish] as interpreted by me. 

[^sad-fish]: Poor fishy at [3:24min](https://youtu.be/hhE7QMXRE1g?t=202), or should I say "pour fishy" amirite.

# First motief
*"I'm a new soul ..."*, 
*"I'm a young soul in this very strange world..."*

| C | F | Am G | C |

In the last repetition, ring out the G instead of playing C:

| C | F | Am G | % |

# Second motief
*"This is a happy end ..."*

| Gb | C | F | Fm | 

To simplify the finger-positioning, we are choosing to only play the lower strings. See the chord diagrams[^diagrams] below for suggestions:
