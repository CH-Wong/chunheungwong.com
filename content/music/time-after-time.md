VERSE 1
  Ly-----ing in my bed I hear the 
| F/C    C       | F/C   C      | 
  clock  tick, and think of you
| F/C    C       | F/C      C   |
  Caught up in     cir------cles
| F/C    C       | F/C      C   |
Confu----sion is   nothing  new
|  F/C   C       | F/C      C   |
(Maybe Dm/C or F6/C intead? Melody stays on a D.)  

PRECHORUS 1
  Flash----back,    warm nights 
| Am       G/B   |  Em   F     |
    Almost left   behind
| F        G     |  Em         |
  Suit-----cases of memories
| F        G     |  Em   F     | 
      Time after...
| F        F/G   | 
(7 bars instead of 8 gives that skippping feel)

VERSE 2
  Some---times you picture     me, I'm
| F/C    C       | F/C         C     |
  wal----king too  far       a-head
| F/C    C       | F/C         C     |
  You're calling   to          me,  I 
| F/C    C       | F/C         C     |
  can't  hear      what you've said
| F/C    C       | F/C         C     |

PRECHORUS 2

| Am       G/B | Em    F                   |
      I fall be--hind
| F     G      | Em                        |
   The second   hand unwinds, If you're lost
| F    G       | Em    F                   |

CHORUS 1
   you can look and you will find me

    Time after time.         If you fall
| F      G     C       | C(7)          |
    I will catch you,  I'll be waiting

  Af----ter     my     picture   fades and 
| F/C   C            | F/C       C        | 
  dark---ness has      turned to gray
| F/C    C           | F/C       C        |
  Wat----ching through wind-----ows, you're

  from deep      inside
| F    G         | Em                       |

CHORUS 2
   you can look and you will find me
