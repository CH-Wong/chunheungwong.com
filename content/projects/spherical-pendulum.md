# A journey into chaos
After reading the book [Chaos: Making a new science (James Gleick, 1987)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science) I was compelled to revisit classical mechanics and see where my curriculum conveniently might have skipped through the non-linear problems. In the book, the [logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map) is shown as one of the simple equations with complicated behaviours.
