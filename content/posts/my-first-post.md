# Welcome to my first static webpage!

When I told my friend I hosted websites on a virtual machine on the cloud, he said: "Chun, it is 2021, this is not the way we do these things anymore". As such, I set out on a journey to host a static webpage. 

## Why a static webpage?
1. Its affordable (<€0.10/mo)

    Instead of paying your favourite cloud service provider (MSFT, Amazon, Google) for running a virtual machine on their systems, you can instead simply store the required html/css files on a filestorage server. This solution is very cheap to provide, and scales with egress (amount of data the service provider needs to send). On MSFT Azure, this costs just €0.14/GB, whereby your website is maybe 1MB. For a website with <1000 users the costs are extremely low. 

2. Its scalable.

    Apparently there is some scalability thing with uptime assurance you can run on these static file hosting services. To be honest, this part kind of went over my head, but my friend assured me this was very important for production level deployment.

3. I haven't tried it before. 

    I like to try new stuff.

What is a more fitting to have as a first post on my static website than a "How to set-up a static website" post?
