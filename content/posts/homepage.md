Hey, I'm Chun Heung Wong and this is my webpage. I intend to share some projects here, mostly for my own easy access, but maybe for somebody else's entertainment. These projects range from [physics simulations](projects/spherical-pendulum), to [musical compositions](music/pinpin), to some [3D printing Arduino projects](projects/esp-thermal-humidity-sensor). 

If you came here looking for my CV, you can find it on my [about page](about/cv).
