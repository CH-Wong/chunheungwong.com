This repository contains the files for my website, which really is just a jumble of notes and thoughts which I easily access. It was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Reminder to self: How to use this again?
Create new content with default templates:
```
hugo new <directory>/<postname>.md
```

Start local development server:
```
hugo server
```
